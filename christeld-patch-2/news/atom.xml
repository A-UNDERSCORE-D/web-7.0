logged out before we stopped the process, receiving a message like "Account

Additionally, we do not store passwords in a recoverable form at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we do recommend using a unique and secure password not shared with
other online services. If you wish to change your password, you may do so using
the command &lt;code&gt;/msg NickServ SET PASSWORD &amp;lt;newpassword&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; while logged in (replacing
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;newpassword&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the password you wish to set). You might wish to consider
using a password manager as well, such as &lt;a href="https://keepassxc.org/"&gt;KeePassXC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do take security and privacy very seriously. Notifications about any actual
security breaches would appear on this site, as well as in global notices sent
out by members of staff (identified by a &lt;code&gt;freenode/staff/&lt;/code&gt; cloak).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;freenode #live returns to We The Curious in Bristol, UK on Saturday 3 and Sunday 4 November 2018. The CFP is now live, and you can submit a talk over at the &lt;a href="https://freenode.live/"&gt;freenode.live&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inaugural freenode #live conference last year saw a star-studded speaker line-up including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/baconandcoconut"&gt;Deb Nicholson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mjg59"&gt;Matthew Garrett&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/o0karen0o"&gt;Karen Sandler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johns_FSF"&gt;John Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jvdwaa"&gt;Jelle van der Waa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lolamby"&gt;Chris Lamb&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nmcgovern"&gt;Neil McGovern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mattdm"&gt;Matthew Miller&lt;/a&gt; and many, many more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;freenode #live 2017 was possible thanks to the generous support of sponsors such as &lt;a href="https://www.bytemark.co.uk"&gt;Bytemark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://falanx.com"&gt;Falanx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.opensuse.org"&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://privateinternetaccess.com"&gt;Private Internet Access&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://yubico.com"&gt;Yubico&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://privateinternetaccess.com"&gt;Private Internet Access&lt;/a&gt; has already agreed to sponsor the event for another year, and we are currently looking for additional sponsors.

Open Source! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate Free and Open Source Software Month, &lt;a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com"&gt;Private Internet Access&lt;/a&gt; is running a promotion this month, with savings of up to 62% if you take out an annual subscription &lt;a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/foss-month"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd love to hear about, and help highlight any other similar promotions run by other companies that are doing something similar to celebrate

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you have something you would like to share with the community? We welcome proposals on all subjects and at any level of technical expertise, please do not feel constrained by the track subjects. We are keen to hear about your experiments, your discoveries, solutions, achievements and even your failures. We want to hear about “how to get started with X,” “how to use Y,” and “what we learned from working on Z”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want you to come teach us something new, we want you to make us think and we want you to make us laugh. Go ahead and submit a proposal for a talk, we’d love to hear your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you could lead a tutorial on something of relevance to the freenode communities or the FOSS ecosystem? Why not throw your ideas in the hat and submit a proposal to hold a workshop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a completely different idea? Is there something you would love to see happen at freenode #live? Let us know! We’re open to all ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to hear from you, if you are planning to come to the event then you are very much part of the community and as such this is very much your conference. We want to hear from you regardless of whether you are a seasoned speaker or if this is the first time you are considering getting up in front of an audience. The freenode community is friendly and welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFP closes on 15 August 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with our main sponsor and co-host of this year’s event, &lt;a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com"&gt;Private Internet Access&lt;/a&gt;, we very much look forward to welcoming you all to Bristol in October!&lt;/p&gt;
