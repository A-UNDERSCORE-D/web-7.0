&lt;p&gt;We are looking for proposals for talks, workshops and other events and as a community-focused organisation, freenode is committed to ensuring that this conference is open to YOUR ideas! The more varied the programme, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you have something you would like to share with the community? We welcome proposals on all subjects and at any level of technical expertise, please do not feel constrained by the track subjects. We are keen to hear about your experiments, your discoveries, solutions, achievements and even your failures. We want to hear about “how to get started with X,” “how to use Y,” and “what we learned from working on Z”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want you to come teach us something new, we want you to make us think and we want you to make us laugh. Go ahead and submit a proposal for a talk, we’d love to hear your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you could lead a tutorial on something of relevance to the freenode communities or the FOSS ecosystem? Why not throw your ideas in the hat and submit a proposal to hold a workshop?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a completely different idea? Is there something you would love to see happen at freenode #live? Let us know! We’re open to all ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to hear from you, if you are planning to come to the event then you are very much part of the community and as such this is very much your conference. We want to hear from you regardless of whether you are a seasoned speaker or if this is the first time you are considering getting up in front of an audience. The freenode community is friendly and welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFP closes on 15 August 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

For the last few years, Private Internet Access has been a dedicated supporter
of the freenode project and we are delighted to be able to announce that
freenode is now officially part of the PIA family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;freenode has been providing services to Free and Open Source Software projects,
peer-directed projects and other projects that have a broadly licensed output
for the past 18 years, and there is a great deal of overlap between the visions
and missions of the two organisations, as well as the projects and
organisations the two organisations have supported, albeit in very different
ways over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob (lilo) founded freenode with the aim of providing a useful service to Free
and Open Source Software communities, peer-directed projects and others and I
think he would be proud of the growth we have experienced over the years if he
were still here to see it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am incredibly excited to be able to share some amazing news with you today.

&lt;p&gt;Rob (lilo) founded freenode with the aim of providing a useful service to Free
and Open Source Software communities, peer-directed projects and others and I
think he would be proud of the growth we have experienced over the years if he
were still here to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I took over freenode following his death, my personal circumstances were
very different from what they are now. I had time—oodles of it—and volunteering
for freenode was very much a pleasure (by all means, it still is! Otherwise I
wouldn't be here). However, over the years, times changed, the project grew,
demands grew, my own responsibilities changed, both professionally and
personally and I, along with several other senior freenode volunteers, found
that we no longer had quite the same amount of time and energy to dedicate to
the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following discussion and deliberation we have decided to formally (and
legally) ally ourselves with PIA. Freenode will continue to operate as a
not-for-profit entity under the same management, with the same principles,
but PIA's involvement going forwards will provide us with opportunities and
resources that we could previously only dream of. PIA will provide an operating
budget, mentorship and support that will allow freenode to implement some of
the projects and ideas that have previously been on the backburner due to
constraints in terms of volunteer time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-what-is-the-incentive-for-pia"&gt;Why? What is the incentive for PIA?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Internet Access is committed to bringing the internet back to its
original state, where being online meant being in your own private world,
exploring, learning and creating. PIA is serious about supporting organisations
and individuals that it considers to be in alignment with its mission and
freenode is one such project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founders of PIA feel that freenode has helped a number of open source
projects progress, that freenode helps the community produce the pieces that
make the internet work smoothly, piece by piece, and that it empowers people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For PIA, this is about giving back, giving back to freenode and to the
communities that they consider vital to their success and to their mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The freenode project would be nothing without its communities. All of our
volunteers come from projects that use freenode, projects we are passionate
about and projects we want to see continue to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the PIA family, we can guarantee that the freenode project will
continue to operate and that we will have the support and resources to further
improve the services that we offer to FOSS communities and others, doing our
bit to ensure that you can all continue doing what you do best—making the
internet and the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-next"&gt;What next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be few noticeable changes in terms of day-to-day operations, the
freenode project will continue to operate with much the same structure and
volunteer base as it does now. We anticipate that group registration will
become a quicker process and we look forward to implementing and announcing new
features in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, I have joined PIA as a full-time employee and I will be
holding a dual role. I will continue to head up the freenode project and you
will no doubt see and hear more of me as my availability and involvement
increases. Some of you might also find yourselves dealing with me in my new
role as Director of Sponsorship and Events at Private Internet Access, where I
will be heading up the work we undertake to support organisations, campaigns
and events globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that you may bump into me at various conferences throughout the
year, and if you do, please do come have a chat—whether about PIA, freenode or
the weather!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of conferences, I am also extremely happy to announce that
freenode #live will be taking place at At-Bristol in Bristol, UK on 28-29th
October 2017. We will shortly be making a separate announcement as we open up

&lt;p&gt;When Aleppo comes up in the news, many of us find ourselves thinking about those
kids and what happened to them. One of our volunteers invested a fair amount of
time trying to figure out where they ended up. When discussing it recently, he
shared his experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After a few weeks of surreal crazy chaos we worked out that they were using a
Java IRC client - and internet café PCs - to connect to our system.  They
didn't know what it was for or why it existed but they'd found real-time
online communication for the first time and were enjoying the shit out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first used IRC in the 90s when an IRC client was given to me by a friend not
very long after it was the medium for some of the first ever real-time citizen
journalism during the 1991 Gulf War. In much the same way that someone threw
some software at me in a computing lab in Oxford and showed me how to use it
to chat, these kids were sharing and collaborating in the streets and using
new tools to talk to the guy a computer or a block or a neighbourhood over
with equal ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we tried to shepherd a group of unruly teenagers into a corner where
they would cause less trouble for everyone else, I got to know a couple of the
better English-speakers quite well; they seemed mostly to be basically decent
kids growing up much too quickly and experiencing my corner of the internet
for the first time. They were mostly in Aleppo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Arab Spring progressed they grew in number and it was genuinely cool
watching them discover and explore. But as spring turned to summer and then
autumn, they gradually dropped in number and started to vanish. After a while
I realised they'd mostly gone, and I tried to track some of the stragglers
down to find out what had happened to the ringleader or any of the kids I'd
gotten to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ringleader had been killed in shellfire, was the answer. I found his blog.
It had been silent for a couple of months. Eventually it fell off the internet
when the account was suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a year later they all seemed to have gone I made more of an effort to do
some digital anthropology and figure out just what had happened to them in
more depth. I talked to a Lebanese peer who ran some adult Arabic language
discussion spaces and he speculated that by that point hey had all died or
fled and crossed the border into other countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we reflect on the sobering condition of the world around us, it would be
easy to forget about the positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the privilege of seeing thousands of people work on thousands of
projects they love, and it's humbling and exciting to be allowed to play a small
part in each of them. We're extremely grateful for that: we love learning about
your projects; we love learning about the different ways in which people
communicate and collaborate; we love learning about what you produce and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have exceptionally generous sponsors who not only provide us with hardware
and bandwidth but also with their continued time and expertise when required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to one such sponsor we have also secured the majority of the requisite
funding to put on a two-day live conference which will take place in the UK in
August 2017. Further details and a formal announcement will follow early in the
New Year. We are incredibly excited and hope that you will join us; we'd love
for your project to exhibit or perhaps you could give a talk? Keep an eye out
for our announcement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, we would like to thank you all for using freenode and wish you the
very best for 2017!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Celebrating Fedora 25 with freenode</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/celebrating-fedora-freenode" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-21T12:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-12-21T12:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Justin W.

&lt;p&gt;On November 22nd, 2016, the &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Overview"&gt;Fedora
Project&lt;/a&gt; released Fedora 25,
the latest and greatest version of our
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel"&gt;Linux-based&lt;/a&gt; operating
system. For &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2003-November/msg00000.html"&gt;over thirteen
years&lt;/a&gt;,
the Fedora community has worked to bring the leading edge of open source
development to the world. Fedora's focus is guided by its &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Foundations"&gt;Four
Foundations&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Freedom,
Friends, Features, First&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Freedom&lt;/em&gt; is representative of Fedora's
commitment to championing free and open source software and contributing
back to upstream projects for the benefit of the open source community.
&lt;em&gt;Features&lt;/em&gt; stands for Fedora's commitment to driving some of the newest
features &lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt;. Some of these examples include the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)"&gt;Wayland display
server&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd"&gt;systemd&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME#GNOME_3"&gt;GNOME
3&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps most
importantly, &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; are for the friendships made by contributors from
around the world who help make every release of Fedora possible. Part of
why &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; is an important part of the Four Foundations is
communication. Fedora community members come from all over the planet,
including six out of seven continents. The tools we use to communicate
help us collaborate, solve problems, and build friendships. IRC and
freenode are an important part of how we communicate. Fedora registered
our first channel on freenode on December 29, 2002. As we celebrate
thirteen years of open source collaboration and the newest release of
Fedora 25, the Fedora community wanted to reflect on our longstanding

&lt;h2 id="how-fedora-uses-freenode"&gt;How Fedora uses freenode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a large open source project, there are many different teams and
sub-projects in Fedora that help move us toward a new release. Just like
there are many parts to a car's engine, there are many parts to Fedora's
engine. Some of these groups are officially recognized sub-projects like
the &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Design"&gt;Design team&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CommOps"&gt;Community
Operations&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Docs_Project"&gt;Docs
team&lt;/a&gt;. Other times, they
are informal &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:SIGs"&gt;Special Interest
Groups&lt;/a&gt; (SIGs) that bring
contributors together to focus on specific topics like programming
languages or desktop environments, like the &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Python"&gt;Python
SIG&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/KDE"&gt;KDE
SIG&lt;/a&gt;. Usually, each of these
groups or teams will have their own IRC channel to coordinate in. The
Design team uses &lt;code&gt;#fedora-design&lt;/code&gt;, the Python SIG uses &lt;code&gt;#fedora-python&lt;/code&gt;…
and so on. In total, Fedora has over 175 registered channels to its
name. Frequently, teams will hold public meetings in the freenode
channels to work through tickets, plan ahead on upcoming tasks, or
discuss important topics for their team. There are a series of special
meeting channels used for this purpose. Using the
&lt;a href="http://meetbot.debian.net/Manual.html"&gt;MeetBot&lt;/a&gt; plugin, Fedora uses our
own &lt;a href="https://github.com/fedora-infra/supybot-fedora"&gt;zodbot&lt;/a&gt; to help run
meetings, mark up links or important ideas, and create a pretty HTML
summary at the end of the meeting. All of these summaries and full logs
are found at
&lt;a href="https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/"&gt;meetbot.fedoraproject.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tips-to-using-irc-effectively"&gt;Tips to using IRC effectively&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless different workflows, IRC clients, and handy plugins
available to customize the IRC experience. In the spirit of the
&lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; Foundation and the Code of Conduct, Fedora contributors are
encouraged to &lt;a href="https://getfedora.org/code-of-conduct"&gt;always be excellent to one
another&lt;/a&gt;. It's important to
follow good manners in any IRC channel, Fedora or any other. Having good
manners in IRC are as important as it is in real life. Be courteous to
others, and if in doubt, it's good to assume the best intentions by
others. IRC is important for Fedora, and many contributors have put
together guides of our own as well. You can read more tips from the
Fedora team in our &lt;a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/beginners-guide-irc/"&gt;IRC Beginner's
Guide&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/"&gt;Fedora
Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next-for-fedora"&gt;What's next for Fedora?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 2016 comes to an end, we're wrapping up on our own new release of
Fedora 25. The Fedora community is looking forward to helping drive open
source innovation and contributing to the Linux community for many years
to come. Fedora currently has more than 2,000 contributors, and in the
tenth percentile of active contributors, 65% of them are from the
community (&lt;a href="https://mattdm.org/fedora/2016flock/StateofFedoraAugust2016-v160731a.pdf"&gt;State of Fedora, Flock
2016&lt;/a&gt;).
The Fedora steam engine is chugging ahead, and we're excited to see
where it takes us next. We're happy to be able to have shared past,
current, and future milestones together with the freenode community.
Keep an eye out for Fedora Ambassadors in Europe during
&lt;a href="https://devconf.cz/"&gt;DevConf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2017/"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;.
You can also find us in North America at &lt;a href="https://brickhack.io/"&gt;BrickHack
2017&lt;/a&gt;. And there will be more events all through
the year you can keep an eye out for us at!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>A brief security update from the infrastructure team</title><link href="https://freenode.net/news/PSA-brief-update-infra" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-20T05:30:34+00:00</published><updated>2016-12-20T05:30:34+00:00</updated><author><name>christel</name></author><id>tag:freenode.net,2016-12-20:/news/PSA-brief-update-infra</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A freenode volunteer has identified and responded to a suspected compromise of their e-mail accounts, which could have provided
