    <p>Af­ter <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/30/will-irseek-have-a-chilling-effect-on-irc-chat/">this</a> recent article on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">techcrunch.com</a> many of our users have contacted freenode staff to express their concern, shock, surprise and unease that IRseeK have for some time now been operating covert clients in various channels on freenode (and other IRC Networks) logging all communication and publishing it on their website.</p>
<p>We, freen­ode staff, are also sur­prised, not to men­tion rather up­set, that this com­pa­ny has cho­sen to com­plete­ly ig­nore our poli­cies and per­form ac­tions which our users see as an in­va­sion of their pri­va­cy. While we have con­tact­ed B &amp; C Ad­vanced So­lu­tions, the com­pa­ny be­hind IRseeK, to re­quest that they dis­con­tin­ue unau­tho­rized log­ging on freen­ode and also that they re­move any pub­lished logs, we have un­for­tu­nate­ly had to take the ad­di­tion­al step of block­ing new tor con­nec­tions while we pur­sue the mat­ter fur­ther. The log­ging bots pri­mar­i­ly con­nect through tor, seem to have no dis­tin­guish­ing char­ac­ter­is­tics that we can iden­ti­fy, and so far the com­pa­ny has not been will­ing to re­move them vol­un­tar­i­ly. We are cur­rent­ly re­mov­ing the bots as we see them, and if you do spot a client you be­lieve may be a IRseeK log­ging bot, please do let staff know and they will look into whether the client needs to be re­moved from the net­work. To all le­git­i­mate tor users out there, I apol­o­gise for the in­con­ve­nience caused and hope to have nor­mal ser­vice re­stored as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
<p>Our web­site clear­ly states our poli­cies on this top­ic, which have been pub­lished for sev­er­al years. For those who haven't read them re­cent­ly, I quote one of the rel­e­vant sec­tions:</p>
<p><em><strong>"If you're con­sid­er­ing pub­lish­ing chan­nel logs,       think it through.     </strong>          The freenode network is an interactive     environment.  Even on public channels, most users don't weigh their     comments with the idea that they'll be enshrined in perpetuity. For that     reason, few participants publish logs.</em></p>
<p><em>If you're pub­lish­ing logs on an on­go­ing ba­sis, your chan­nel top­ic should     re­flect that fact. Be sure to pro­vide a way for users to make com­ments     with­out log­ging, and get per­mis­sion from the chan­nel own­ers be­fore you     start.  If you're think­ing of "anonymiz­ing" your logs (re­mov­ing     in­for­ma­tion that iden­ti­fies the spe­cif­ic users), be aware that it's     dif­fi­cult to do it well—replies and gen­er­al con­text of­ten pro­vide     iden­ti­fy­ing in­for­ma­tion which is hard to fil­ter.</em></p>
<p><em>If you just want to pub­lish a sin­gle con­ver­sa­tion, be care­ful to get     per­mis­sion from each par­tic­i­pant. Pro­vide as much con­text as you can.      Avoid the temp­ta­tion to pub­lish or dis­trib­ute logs with­out per­mis­sion in     or­der to por­tray some­one in a bad light. The rep­u­ta­tion you save will     most like­ly be your own.              "</em></p>
<p>And this per­haps, is where I feel that IRseeK has gone hor­ri­bly wrong. I be­lieve that this could have be­come a pop­u­lar ser­vice had it been done in a way which pro­motes choice -- op­er­at­ing on an op­t-in ba­sis could very well have meant that a lot of chan­nel own­ers would have cho­sen to re­quest an IRseeK log­ging bot in their chan­nel so that logs could be ref­er­enced and looked at lat­er.</p>
<p>How­ev­er, cur­rent­ly there is no way to op­t-in, or even to opt out. The bots aren't eas­i­ly iden­ti­fi­able and you're not aware that they are present in your chan­nel. Ide­al­ly, I would have liked to see:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Log­ging bots clear­ly iden­ti­fi­able as such.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log­ging of chan­nels oc­cur­ring only at the chan­nel own­er­s' re­quest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chan­nels that opt in to this ser­vice dis­play­ing, in a way which is vis­i­ble to all cur­rent and new users of the chan­nel, that the chan­nel is be­ing logged and the logs made pub­li­cal­ly avail­able on the web. The chan­nel top­ic and on-join no­tice could eas­i­ly be used to this ef­fect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An easy method to re­move log­ging bots from a chan­nel should it join in er­ror or a chan­nel own­er de­cide that they no longer wish their chan­nel to be logged.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Per­haps, in this re­gard, they could have tak­en a leaf out of <a href="http://www.cia.vc">CIA's</a> book and become a lot more popular in the process.</p>
<p>To me, the biggest sur­prise is that the peo­ple be­hind IRseeK de­fend their ac­tions and be­lieve that they are en­tire­ly with­in their rights to do what they do in the man­ner that they do it. Leav­ing our guide­lines aside for a mo­ment, what irks me is this: freen­ode caters pri­mar­i­ly to peo­ple from the FOSS com­mu­ni­ties, peo­ple to whom choice and free­dom are im­por­tant. For us, pro­vid­ing a ser­vice such as freen­ode to our com­mu­ni­ty is im­por­tant; our users give a lot, we share code, knowl­edge, hints, frus­tra­tions, laugh­ter..  and we like to give back in the lit­tle way we can. It then does not feel com­fort­able or at all right to have some­one in­trude upon our pri­va­cy, sneak­ing into the cir­cle and ob­serv­ing with the sin­gu­lar aim of pub­li­cis­ing our con­ver­sa­tions en­tire­ly with­out our knowl­edge or con­sent. By tak­ing the route that they did, IRseeK has tak­en away our free­dom and our choice. They have forced some­thing down on us and in the process soured and poi­soned a com­mu­ni­ty which thrives on trust and col­lab­o­ra­tion. It has cre­at­ed a bad at­mos­phere and made a lot of peo­ple un­com­fort­able.</p>
<p>I am re­al­ly sor­ry that this prob­lem has reached our net­work, and I am re­al­ly sor­ry for the way it has af­fect­ed our com­mu­ni­ty. I am also sor­ry for the way in which IRseeK choose to per­form their ac­tions, and sor­ri­er still that we did not catch it soon­er.</p>
<p>I sin­cere­ly hope that IRseeK will ho­n­our our re­quest to stop at­tempt­ing to log chan­nels on freen­ode with­out the chan­nel own­er's ex­plic­it per­mis­sion, and I also hope that they will ho­n­our our re­quest to re­move logs al­ready in their sys­tem.</p>
<p>Last­ly, I would like to wish IRseeK well, and I hope that you re-­con­sid­er your ap­proach. I be­lieve that if done prop­er­ly, what you have could be turned into a re­spectable ser­vice which would be used by and ap­pre­ci­at­ed by a lot of peo­ple.</p>
<p>As I said, we have got­ten in touch with the peo­ple be­hind IRseeK and they have asked to have un­til this sun­day (to­mor­row) to re­spond. I will give you an up­date when we hear back from them and know which way the tide is turn­ing.</p>
<p>For now, thank you for us­ing freen­ode and have a great day!</p>
