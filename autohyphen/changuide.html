    <h1>Channel Guidelines</h1>
    <p>IRC is a low-band­width method of com­mu­ni­ca­tion, in com­par­i­son with phys­i­cal pres­ence. Many of the cues of phys­i­cal com­mu­ni­ca­tion, tone of voice, fa­cial ex­pres­sion, hand move­ments, etc., are miss­ing in IRC, since only text is trans­mit­ted back and forth.
Speak­ers in phys­i­cal prox­im­i­ty with each oth­er com­mu­ni­cate quite a bit of emo­tion­al con­text via this ex­tra band­width. This con­text en­ables them to avoid mis­judg­ing the in­tent of their con­ver­sa­tion­al part­ners. It also func­tions as an un­con­scious neg­a­tive feed­back mech­a­nism to re­duce the in­ci­dence of emo­tion­al "firestorms" which tend to dis­rupt the ef­fi­cient flow of con­ver­sa­tion. Hu­man be­ings look for this feed­back, and in­deed they may have evolved to re­quire it. In the low-band­width world of IRC, they must in­stead rely on emo­tion­al feed­back from the text they re­ceive.</p>
<p>This process is sub­ject to ex­ag­ger­a­tion. Small amounts of emo­tion be­come mag­ni­fied in the per­cep­tion of the ob­serv­er. So, it is very im­por­tant to keep chan­nels calm. An in­for­mal con­cep­tu­al mea­sure­ment of the emo­tion­al con­tent of a chan­nel is its "chan­nel tem­per­a­ture."</p>
<p>Think of a per­son­'s emo­tion­al state as ki­net­ic en­er­gy. En­thu­si­asm, hap­pi­ness, anger, frus­tra­tion all add to the en­er­gy lev­el. The more emo­tion is ex­pe­ri­enced, the "hot­ter" the par­tic­i­pant. The av­er­age emo­tion­al state of a chan­nel is its tem­per­a­ture. Emo­tions in IRC be­come ex­ag­ger­at­ed and con­vey­ing them di­rect­ly in­creas­es chan­nel tem­per­a­ture. Pen­t-up frus­tra­tion, in par­tic­u­lar, is of­ten re­leased as a se­ries of in­ap­pro­pri­ate, "high en­er­gy" out­bursts. An im­por­tant ob­jec­tive of the freen­ode chan­nel guide­lines is to avoid "feed­back loops" in chan­nel in­ter­ac­tions by re­duc­ing chan­nel tem­per­a­ture.</p>
<p>The guide­lines which fol­low are de­signed with the ben­e­fit of years of ex­pe­ri­ence with IRC, be­gin­ning dur­ing the 1993-1994 pe­ri­od when the de­sign lim­i­ta­tions of IRC be­gan to be­come clear due to the in­creas­ing scale of IRC net­works. Adopt­ing the guide­lines will help im­prove the over­all qual­i­ty of your chan­nel, and of the dis­cus­sions that can take place in it.
We in­ten­tion­al­ly avoid draw­ing a dis­tinc­tion be­tween chan­nel op­er­a­tors and users. Every­one is a user, re­gard­less of their priv­i­lege lev­el, and each user has the abil­i­ty to in­flu­ence the us­abil­i­ty of the chan­nel.</p>
<h2 id="guidelines">Guidelines:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pol­ish your cat­a­lyst skills.</strong> The catalyst role is crucial to keeping channel interactions friendly and efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Look for the best in peo­ple.</strong> If you assume people have no self-control, they will confirm your belief. If you look for personal responsibility, and ask for personal responsibility, most people will respond well.</li>
<li><strong>Set a good ex­am­ple.</strong> Be what you want other people to be. If you want them to be calm, be calm. If you want them to be courteous and friendly, be courteous and friendly. The habitual behaviour of people on a channel is the most powerful influence on newbies arriving on the channel.</li>
<li><strong>Be nice if some­one mes­sages you.</strong> They have gone to the trouble to seek out someone with the background to help them. You are it! Be flattered they have singled you out. If you think they will get better support by asking their question on channel, just let them know.</li>
<li><strong>Don't dis­play chan­nel op­er­a­tor priv­i­leges.</strong> Displaying these privileges on your nick with a "+o" attracts participants who are interested in gaining them and using them actively; it also attracts the attention of participants who react negatively to authority. Have your account added to the channel access list and op yourself only when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Use chan­nel op­er­a­tor priv­i­leges spar­ing­ly.</strong> Each time you use them you raise the channel temperature. Users will be pleased with you, angry at you, frustrated that you used them inappropriately, envious that you have control over the discussion. None of these reactions may be conscious on the part of other users, but all of them increase the channel temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid high­light­ing and rep­e­ti­tion.</strong> Words and sentences in all-uppercase, heavy use of highlighting, beeping (^G) on public channels, repeating the same lines over and over--all of these behaviours irritate people and raise the channel temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid emo­tive speech.</strong> Slang pertaining to sex and sexual orientation, excretion and religious oaths are rarely used to discuss the applicability of those topics to your group's activities. In general, language with strong emotional content and only light meaning should be considered "emotive speech". It does not matter whether the language is socially acceptable or unacceptable. For example, use of the word "fsck" which does not refer to a Unix filesystem check is emotive. Similarly, use of the word "gay" which has nothing to do with homosexuality is emotive. Emotive speech raises the channel temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid sen­si­tive ma­te­r­i­al.</strong> Some users on freenode channels, particularly on public channels, are quite young. Others are parents or teachers who might have young children nearby. As you type comments or ASCII art, or post URLs for others to view, please consider the age range of other users on your channel, and respect the right of parents and teachers to decide when and if to expose the children in their charge to material or language which might offend, confuse or raise difficult issues.
  Additionally, some of our users connect to freenode from corporate environments. Employers may be unhappy with the unexpected appearance of sensitive material on workplace computers. Please be considerate and avoid posting such material when you are not completely sure it is safe to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid ad­vo­ca­cy de­bates.</strong> BSD versus GPL, vi versus emacs, centralised versus decentralised, RMS versus ESR: these discussions are frequently religious and may not involve significant new ideas. They can also raise the channel temperature quite a bit. Certain advocacy discussions, such as those revolving around actual religion or politics, are almost guaranteed to raise the channel temperature to levels that make other conversation difficult.
  You might not get too worked up if you are arguing the relative merits of poll() or kqueue(), but if you walk into a discussion with a strong emotional need to "get your way," consider the possibility you are simply arguing preference or personal affiliation. Advocacy discussions are best held quietly, via /msg, or on channels especially created for the purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Take crit­i­cism to pri­vate mes­sage.</strong> Criticising someone's behaviour on channel holds them up to public scrutiny in a negative way. It's usually overkill. In your messages, do not address the subject of whether you have channel operator privileges; just be courteous. Request nicely that they change their behaviour. In many cases you will discover that problem user you are dealing with is merely inexperienced. An aggressive tone makes for a longer and more involved discussion, and pent-up frustration which will raise the channel temperature sooner or later. You can always use channel operator privileges, or have someone else use them, as needed; but with a courteous tone, you will need to do that a lot less.</li>
<li><strong>Don't be elit­ist.</strong> Today's newbies are tomorrow's experts. A support channel is a place where people with knowledge lead by example. Is the example you want to set that technical knowledge is a hierarchy of control, or that people with knowledge have an inherent social advantage over people who do not? Helping other people takes patience. It is better not to answer a question than to use the opportunity to emphasise the limitations of the person you are trying to help.</li>
<li><strong>Don't be caught by sup­port burnout.</strong> It is nearly impossible to answer every technical question that comes to your channel. In many cases, the problem does not lie in the technical aspects of the question; cultural barriers may get in the way of communication, or it may be difficult to explain to a newbie just where to begin. When you try to answer every question, regardless of difficulty, you set yourself up for <strong>sup­port burnout</strong>.
   Support burnout is nearly always accompanied by the feeling that you are losing control of your time, that the people you have set out to help are making unreasonable demands. The problem is that you are taking on too much responsibility; but it begins to appear instead that the problem is the end user who is asking for help.
   Different people react to support burnout in different ways. Some offer malicious advice ("rm -rf /" etc.) to newbies. Some insist that every question a newbie asks should be answered with a URL or by lists of manual references.
   When the staff of a support channel suffer from support burnout, they are likely to set arbitrary rules for participation; these might include prohibiting the use of certain phrases in channel, or disallowing the use of private messages to contact channel members. Staff might promulgate a lengthy, multi-page rules document ending with a special procedure the user must employ to be voiced in the channel (to make sure they have read the entire document before asking any questions).
   Such arbitrary rule sets tend to grow longer over time, because they do not solve the real problem. <strong>You can­not an­swer every ques­tion, and you should not try.</strong> Be gentle, be courteous, be flexible and be as patient and helpful as you can---but let someone else try to answer questions that you find too frustrating. Do not try to be a superhuman support machine.</li>
<li><strong>If you are con­sid­er­ing pub­lish­ing chan­nel logs</strong>, think it through. The freenode network is an interactive, real-time environment where discussions may be heavily influenced by external context. Even on public channels, most users do not weigh their comments with the idea that they will be enshrined in perpetuity to stand on their own. For that reason, few participants publish logs and we encourage those communities that do to make their participants aware of this fact.</li>
