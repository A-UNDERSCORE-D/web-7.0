    <h1>Catalyst Guidelines</h1>
    <p>The "cat­a­lyst" role is crit­i­cal to freen­ode and an es­sen­tial build­ing block of ef­fec­tive com­mu­ni­ties. No one is re­quired to be a cat­a­lyst, but the users who per­form this role en­sure the smooth and ef­fi­cient func­tion­ing of the net­work.</p>
<p>The IRC plat­form does not au­to­mat­i­cal­ly pro­duce a sta­ble cul­ture of co­op­er­a­tive ef­fort. Even in cas­es where co­op­er­a­tion is in­tend­ed, mis­un­der­stand­ings and per­son­al­i­ty in­com­pat­i­bil­i­ties can re­sult in an ex­treme­ly chaot­ic and hos­tile en­vi­ron­ment. Cat­a­lysts help pre­vent and re­solve mis­un­der­stand­ing, calm the wa­ters when users have dif­fi­cul­ties deal­ing with each oth­er and pro­vide ex­am­ples of con­struc­tive be­hav­iour in en­vi­ron­ments where such be­hav­iour might not oth­er­wise be the norm.</p>
<p>Cat­a­lysts try to re­solve prob­lems, not through the use of au­thor­i­ty and spe­cial priv­i­lege, but by fos­ter­ing con­sen­sus, gen­tly nudg­ing par­tic­i­pants in the di­rec­tion of more ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour and by gen­er­al­ly re­duc­ing the lev­el of con­fronta­tion rather than con­fronting users with prob­lems.</p>
<p>Chan­nel and net­work ad­min­is­tra­tors may be cat­a­lysts and, in­deed, are en­cour­aged to take on that role. Chan­nels which recog­nise the im­por­tance of the cat­a­lyst role will fos­ter more ef­fec­tive co­or­di­na­tion of ef­fort. An im­por­tant char­ac­ter­is­tic of suc­cess­ful cat­a­lysts is the in­fre­quen­cy with which they wear au­thor­i­ty or in­voke spe­cial priv­i­lege.
freen­ode vol­un­teers and spon­sors are ad­vised that an un­der­stand­ing and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the cat­a­lyst’s role is es­sen­tial to un­der­stand­ing the na­ture and in­tend­ed pur­pose of the net­work.</p>
<h2 id="an-effective-catalyst-is">An effective catalyst is:</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Re­laxed.</strong> To keep things calm, you yourself must be calm. Learn the skills of staying genuinely relaxed. Know your limitations; when you can't handle a problem situation calmly, get calmer heads involved.</li>
<li><strong>Open-­mind­ed.</strong> It is easy to make assumptions about other people's motivations. When you decide someone is behaving maliciously, you have made an assumption about their motivation which may be difficult to disprove. Try to make your assumptions about other people's motivations as positive as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Re­spon­si­ble.</strong> Peer-directed projects are a group activity with a strong need for responsible individual behaviour. Rumours, innuendo and gossip can derail projects and ruin reputations. If everybody knows something is true, who is "everybody?" Did the person you are talking to get their information from documented, factual sources, or is it hearsay? If you cannot be sure of the answer to those questions, should you be passing on what they have said?</li>
<li><strong>Un­ob­tru­sive.</strong> It is not necessary to invoke authority to help solve a problem, and far better if you do not. Look for an opportunity to nudge the situation into a more productive track. Do not criticise the user if a quiet change of subject, or a private conversation on a completely different topic, can help make the problem fade away.</li>
<li><strong>Re­al­is­tic.</strong> Accept the personalities of your users and concentrate on problem resolution. Do not expect people to suddenly change their personalities to make problem resolution easier.</li>
<li><strong>Care­ful.</strong> Everything you say will be interpreted by the users with whom you interact. Consider how your remarks will be interpreted before you make them. Make sure the message you convey is the one you intend.</li>
<li><strong>At­ten­tive.</strong> Understand the situation you have walked into before you act. Question your assumptions. Look for signs that you may have misinterpreted the situation, in order to avoid causing difficulties for a user who did not create the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Min­i­mal­ist.</strong> Do not do more than you need to in order to resolve a problem. A problem scene is often the wrong time and place to set policy. Concentrate on the resolution, and on collecting information you can think about later.</li>
<li><strong>Cour­te­ous.</strong> Even under time pressure, courtesy costs little and impresses people a lot. It is not about whether working with the person is easy or difficult; it is about setting the right tone.</li>
<li><strong>Co­op­er­a­tive.</strong> Look for opportunities to get people involved in the resolution of their own and others' problems.</li>
<li><strong>Some­one with an in­ter­nal lo­cus of con­trol.</strong> Catalysts concentrate on solving problems, not bestowing blame. Treat the situation as the problem, accept the users for who they are and try to figure out how best to help resolve the difficulty.</li>
<li><strong>A user.</strong> Remember that you are not in charge. Everybody runs their own little corner of the world. Let them do the job they are capable of. Just help the process along as unobtrusively as possible. Other catalysts are users as well, and nobody is perfect. </li>
</ol>
<p>We are all just here to do our best to keep things run­ning well.</p>
