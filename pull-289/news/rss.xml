Once again &lt;a href="http://freenode.net/news/community"&gt;the freenode community team&lt;/a&gt;
is pleased to announce another AMA, Ask Me Anything. This time &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;
will be our guest. Read more about them in the
&lt;a href="http://freenode.net/news/django-and-freenode"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; published last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your chance to ask Django all your questions about them,
how they utilize freenode, how you can contribute, or anything else you would
be intrested in learning about them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMA is scheduled to take place on Wed Feb 22 18:00:00 UTC, 2017,
so grab your calendar and make sure you won't miss it.
You can watch the AMA in #freenode-ama and participate by asking questions
in #freenode-ama-questions during the session.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Swant</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2017 17:55:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Django and freenode</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/django-and-freenode</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For nearly twelve years, the &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django Project&lt;/a&gt;
has endeavoured to improve "the web framework for perfectionists with
deadlines." Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourage
rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced
developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development,
so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the
wheel. Of course, it's free and open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m contracted full-time by the Django Software Foundation
&lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/#fellowship-program"&gt;as a fellow&lt;/a&gt;,
to manage some of the administrative and community management tasks of
the Django project to support rapid development of Django itself. The
fellowship program has a major positive impact on how Django is
developed and maintained, and I’d encourage any large open source
project to consider a similar program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Django community is vibrant across the globe, with many annual
conferences and local meetups. Sprints are often held at these events,
but Django’s development is mainly coordinated remotely, so good
communication tools are important to us.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tim Graham (timograham)</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 20:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Fedora AMA</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/fedora-ama</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="community"&gt;freenode Community Team&lt;/a&gt; is pleased to announce a new
opportunity to learn about one of our many groups on freenode.
Justin W. Flory (jflory7) from the Fedora project has agreed to follow-up on
his recent &lt;a href="celebrating-fedora-freenode"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; with an "Ask Me
Anything" (AMA) session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who might not be familiar with an AMA, as its name suggests,
it is an opportunity for you to ask the Fedora project all of those questions
that you have been wondering. You can ask about the project itself, how they
utilize freenode, ways to start contributing, or any other topics you might be
interested in learning more about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session is scheduled to take place on Wed Jan 25 18:00:00 UTC 2017.
You can watch the AMA in &lt;code&gt;#freenode-ama&lt;/code&gt; and participate by asking questions in
&lt;code&gt;#freenode-ama-questions&lt;/code&gt; during the session.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nathan Handler (nhandler)</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2017 15:24:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>New Year, New freenode</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/new-year-new-freenode</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, not entirely new but we are about to embark upon a spot of maintenance
and some minor upgrades that could cause some disruption on the freenode
network as servers are being brought down for maintenance, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to apologise in advance and further updates will be provided by
way of global notices and wallops, depending on what we deem necessary for the
interventions concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience and understanding while we carry out the
maintenance and thank you for using freenode!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2017 11:33:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Happy New Year!</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/2016-is-finally-dead</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Another year comes to an end: 2016, a year many will be glad to see the back
of. For many the year has been dominated by uncertainty, by fear, and by
sadness—a year dominated, in no small part, by the political shift on both
sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a year dominated by death. We have looked on in surprise as icon after icon
has passed away throughout the course of the year. We have looked on in sadness
as masses of people have succumbed to terror and war. We have looked on as
people try to flee, in search of a better life, often not succeeding. And as a
project based in the UK we look on as the government tries to do its best to
put an end to our digital rights, to our privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, freenode experienced a sudden influx of Arabic-speaking users.
They came out of nowhere and there were lots of them. Their arrival caused some
distress to the existing communities on the network at the time; freenode
predominantly caters to free and open source software developers and users and
we were all somewhat perplexed when our network was overrun by teenagers
wanting to chat about girls and football. They all seemed to be connecting from
Syria.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2016 09:46:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Celebrating Fedora 25 with freenode</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/celebrating-fedora-freenode</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Celebrating Fedora 25 with freenode" src="../static/img/celebrating-fedora-freenode.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 22nd, 2016, the &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Overview"&gt;Fedora
Project&lt;/a&gt; released Fedora 25,
the latest and greatest version of our
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel"&gt;Linux-based&lt;/a&gt; operating
system. For &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2003-November/msg00000.html"&gt;over thirteen
years&lt;/a&gt;,
the Fedora community has worked to bring the leading edge of open source
development to the world. Fedora's focus is guided by its &lt;a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Foundations"&gt;Four
Foundations&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Freedom,
Friends, Features, First&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Freedom&lt;/em&gt; is representative of Fedora's
commitment to championing free and open source software and contributing
back to upstream projects for the benefit of the open source community.
&lt;em&gt;Features&lt;/em&gt; stands for Fedora's commitment to driving some of the newest
features &lt;em&gt;First&lt;/em&gt;. Some of these examples include the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)"&gt;Wayland display
server&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd"&gt;systemd&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME#GNOME_3"&gt;GNOME
3&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps most
importantly, &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; are for the friendships made by contributors from
around the world who help make every release of Fedora possible. Part of
why &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; is an important part of the Four Foundations is
communication. Fedora community members come from all over the planet,
including six out of seven continents. The tools we use to communicate
help us collaborate, solve problems, and build friendships. IRC and
freenode are an important part of how we communicate. Fedora registered
our first channel on freenode on December 29, 2002. As we celebrate
thirteen years of open source collaboration and the newest release of
Fedora 25, the Fedora community wanted to reflect on our longstanding
relationship with freenode.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Justin W. Flory (jflory7)</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2016 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>A brief security update from the infrastructure team</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/PSA-brief-update-infra</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A freenode volunteer has identified and responded to a suspected compromise of their e-mail accounts, which could have provided 
an unauthorised user with limited access to some data sent via internal e-mail systems (this could include support tickets or 
internal communications).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, we instigated audit procedures immediately so as to ensure the security of the production network and accompanying 
infrastructure. The investigation is ongoing, but at this time we have no reason to believe that any other unauthorised access 
was gained. Nevertheless, in the interests of transparency and security for our users, we wish to notify anyone who may have 
been affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, we would still recommend that you ensure that you change any passwords to freenode systems, and be alert to any 
suspicious activity on your account. We would additionally always recommend that you not share passwords between accounts, 
especially those spanning multiple providers (please ensure you have a registered e-mail address before changing your password 
so that it can be reset!).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2016 05:30:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>freenode Community Team</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/community</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might not be aware that freenode has a dedicated community team and that we
would be delighted to help your projects get the most from freenode. The
freenode community team consists of christel, edk, JonathanD, mquin, Myrtti,
nhandler, Swant and tomaw, and we would love to help you spread the word about
releases and launches, conferences or events and any other project milestones
that may be of interest to our shared communities. We are happy to make
announcements on IRC, reshare your social media posts and we would love for you
to guest author or co-author a blog post for the freenode website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think this is something that would be useful for your project, please do
not hesitate to get in touch with us! You can find us in &lt;code&gt;#freenode-community&lt;/code&gt;
or drop us a line to &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#109;&amp;#117;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#121;&amp;#64;&amp;#102;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#100;&amp;#101;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;"&gt;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&amp;#109;&amp;#117;&amp;#110;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#121;&amp;#64;&amp;#102;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#100;&amp;#101;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Swant</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2016 21:34:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Resurrecting Tor, continued</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/tor-online</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Following an embarrassingly long period of no Tor support, we &lt;a href="resurrecting-tor"&gt;recently
blogged&lt;/a&gt; about resurrecting Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, Tor users can once more connect to freenode over Tor; the hidden
service address is&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2016 20:18:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Resurrecting tor-sasl</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/resurrecting-tor</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As many of you will no doubt be aware, freenode used to run a Tor hidden
service, providing anonymous access to the network. Unfortunately, this had to
be disabled due to concerns about abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We regret that it has taken some time to resolve this issue but we are now
almost ready to deploy some software updates that will allow us to re-enable the
gateway. We've made one important change: password-based SASL authentication is
disabled over the Tor gateway, so you'll need to generate a client certificate
and add its fingerprint (&lt;code&gt;/msg NickServ CERT ADD&lt;/code&gt;) over a regular connection
before connecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd appreciate your help testing this setup on &lt;a href="ircs://testnet.freenode.net:9003"&gt;our
testnet&lt;/a&gt;. Further instructions can be found
in &lt;code&gt;#freenode&lt;/code&gt; there. (if you already have a certificate set, the hidden
service is at
&lt;a href="ircs://testnet67chdulhs.onion:6697"&gt;ircs://testnet67chdulhs.onion:6697&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">edk</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2016 16:09:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>Happy Birthday to the World Wide Web</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/www25</link><description>&lt;p&gt;25 years ago—On the 6'th of August 1991—the world's first website went live,
and it's &lt;a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html"&gt;still there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the world wide web is celebrating silver jubilee today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine where we would've been without it. Would your project exist? Would
freenode exist?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Swant</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Aug 2016 22:06:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>A Reminder</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/a-reminder</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the distant past, freenode fairly frequently sent /wallops about news of
conferences, releases or anything else that might be of interest to the FOSS
community. We'd quite like to do more of that, so… if you know of anything that
might fit the bill, please drop the community team a line at
&lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#103;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#117;&amp;#112;&amp;#115;&amp;#64;&amp;#102;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#100;&amp;#101;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;"&gt;&amp;#103;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#117;&amp;#112;&amp;#115;&amp;#64;&amp;#102;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#100;&amp;#101;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&lt;/a&gt; or message me (my nickname is &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;) on IRC (even if the
project in question isn't (yet) registered with freenode).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd also like to feature a bit more FOSS news on our blog, so if you're itching
to write a guest post for us, I'd love to hear about that as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">edk</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2016 22:06:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Help protect net neutrality in the EU</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/eu-net-neutrality</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As many of you no doubt know, the European Union passed legislation last year
intended to protect
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality"&gt;net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;.
However, it contained
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/27/eu-net-neutrality-laws-fatally-undermined-by-loopholes-critics-say"&gt;significant loopholes&lt;/a&gt;
which many people believe will allow European ISPs to prioritise paying
partners' traffic. Among other things, this is potentially quite scary for
FOSS projects—most of which don't have the kind of funding necessary to enter
into such arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is something that concerns you, campaigns aimed at convincing
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_European_Regulators_of_Electronic_Communications"&gt;BEREC&lt;/a&gt;
to close the loopholes are running at &lt;a href="https://www.savenetneutrality.eu/"&gt;https://www.savenetneutrality.eu/&lt;/a&gt; and
