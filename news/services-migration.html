    <span class="art-date">2008-05-29 15:06:27+00:00 by Martinp23</span></p>
    <p class="art-ingress"><p>The time has come for freenode to migrate from our old, legacy services         package to a much newer, actively maintained package known as       <a href="http://www.atheme.net/">Atheme</a>, developed by the          <a href="http://www.atheme.org/">Atheme Project</a>.  Although we,         with the help of the Atheme developers, have tried to make the      migration process as painless as possible, there are still a        few interface differences that you will need to be aware of.        This guide, prepared by tomaw, will attempt to walk you through the main changes, grouped by service.</p>
<h2>NickServ</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>NickServ will now require a valid, verified email           address to register new nicks.  Because of this the             registration command has changed to</p>
<p>/msg NickServ REGISTER <password> <email address></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will the receive a confirmation email with          instructions on how to confirm your account             registration.  Accounts that have been migrated from            theia that did not have an email address set will find          that their address is set to 'nomail'.  <strong>These users           should set an email address as soon as possible.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New NickServ accounts that are registered but not           confirmed will be <strong>automatically</strong> dropped after 24            hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was Nick Linking has now been replaced with            Nick Grouping.  This means that you have just one           account (including one password, one email address etc.)            but potentially multiple Nicks associated with that             account.   For more information please issue the            following command:</p>
<p>/msg NickServ HELP GROUP</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Migrated accounts will have the password associated to          the master nick, but will have the first valid email            address found when searching all linked nicks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SET UNFILTERED has been removed and the global          block on messages from users that have not identified           to NickServ has been removed.  This was only ever           intended to be a temporary measure to combat spam and           we're hopeful that we can deal with those events in             different, less intrusive ways.  UMODE +E remains an            alternative for any users who wish to block such messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SET GSM, PHONE, and the like have been removed and              replaced with a SET PROPERTY feature.  For more information,            see:</p>
<p>/msg NickServ HELP SET PROPERTY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>INFO will no long return a list of channels where you have access.  Instead use:</p>
<p>/msg NickServ LISTCHANS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new SET ENFORCE feature replaces the un-used SET KILL             feature. For details, see</p>
<p>/msg NickServ HELP SET ENFORCE</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>ChanServ</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Channel access is now controlled by a series of flags,          rather than levels.  This will allow channel owners and             Group Contacts to better control the access they grant          users, and to see more clearly what access those users          will have.  Channel Access now also includes a powerful             templating system, making it easier to manage large and             complicated access lists.  For more information on          these features, please see:</p>
<p>/msg ChanServ HELP FLAGS</p>
<p>/msg ChanServ HELP TEMPLATE</p>
<p>/msg ChanServ HELP ACCESS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channel access can now be manipulated using two             different commands.</p>
<p>/msg ChanServ ACCESS #channel</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>behaves similarly to our previous services, but the             standard Atheme command is to use</p>
<pre><code>/msg ChanServ FLAGS
</code></pre>
<p>Note that viewing FLAGS             requires you to have flag +A on the channel in          question, but ACCESS does not.  This can be useful if           you're trying to locate channel operators.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ChanServ can no longer be used to OP or VOICE multiple users, though it is still possibly to OP/VOICE individual users:</p>
<p>/msg ChanServ OP #channel nick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new RECOVER command is now available, which           can be used by the founder to regain control of a           channel which has been "taken over".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channel passwords are no longer used for            registration as all channel access is control by the            access flags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LIST <em>pattern</em> has been replaced by a new service           called ALIS.  See below for details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>ALIS</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ALIS provides a more useful channel list facility than what         was previously available.  It will list matching channels, but      will filter out channels that are not currently in use.  Its        use is similar to the functionality that was previously built       into ChanServ:</p>
<p>/msg ALIS LIST #freenode-*</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>MemoServ</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Memos can now be replied to and forwarded to other users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional email forwarding to your registered email          address.  To enable this feature, issue the following           command:</p>
<p>/msg NickServ SET EMAILMEMOS ON</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully that covers most of the differences that you will         come across during day to day life on freenode.  Of course, if      you have any questions, suggestions or comments, please feel        free to drop by <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/freenode">#freenode</a>, email support (at) freenode (dot) net         or message a member of staff.</p></p>
