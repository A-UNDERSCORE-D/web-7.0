    <p class="art-ingress"><p>We are currently looking to expand the freenode volunteer staff team – seeking people from across the target communities we serve.</p>
<p>Previous irc experience is a bonus, but not a requirement.</p>
<p>We ask that you familiarise yourself with the guidelines, policies, procedures and philosophies as per our website: <a href="http://freenode.net">http://freenode.net</a> and assess whether you feel you agree with what we are all about. We are looking for someone who is able to work as part of a team but also happy to take initiative.</p>
<p>The current volunteer team is a diverse group of people – of all ages and backgrounds. We share a common passion and interest in Free and Open Source Software as well as Free Culture. We are looking for people who would compliment the current set-up and be a refreshing addition to the team – we love suggestions and ideas and appreciate it if you aren't too shy to speak your mind!</p>
<p>The freenode network is run by a great team of volunteers, it's day to day operations are overseen by the Steering Committee under the oversight of Head of Staff. While each freenode staffer has a individual role within the project; utilizing their strengths, experiences and interests the most important role on the network is that of the levelone support volunteer. We encourage all staff, regardless of seniority to spend as much time as possible on levelone duties.</p>
<p>We are currently looking for more staff to join us in order to better serve the groups and projects which use our services, if you should be interested please drop us a few lines to volunteering AT freenode.net letting us know a little bit about yourself, what projects you are currently involved with, why you would be interested in helping out with freenode and why you would be the right person for us to take onboard!</p>
<p>In addition to looking for volunteer staff we are also looking for developers – we are looking for people familiar with Ruby on Rails to work on our Group Management System (GMS) which is a web based dashboard to services, allowing group contacts of projects to better manage their namespace, cloaks etc.</p>
<p>We are also looking for people who could be interested in coming on board to work on 7 (Seven), which is the Charybdis based IRCD which freenode will be moving to. In addition to these, there are also other development opportunities available – and we would love to hear it if you have suggestions for something new/different too! If you are interested in helping out on the coding side, get in touch with us via code AT freenode.net and we'll take it from there!</p>
<p>We hope to hear from you soon – while we will endeavour to get back to all interested parties, please keep in mind that we may not reply to your e-mail before we have reviewed a fair chunk of them. We are putting up a preliminary cut-off date of <strong>January 1st 2008</strong>, and all curious users should receive an indication of interest from us by <strong>January 15th 2008.</strong></p>
<p>For now, happy hacking and er, happy holidays!</p></p>
