&lt;p&gt;Jorge Oliviera from &lt;a href="https://www.jog.center/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;JOG, 6x South Brazil National Champion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2018 20:50:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Celebrating FOSS, and twenty years of Open Source</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/foss-month</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For the last few days I (and several of the freenode volunteers) have had the absolute pleasure of spending time with a wide range of 
freenode users over at &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2018/"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt; in Brussels. FOSDEM has always provided us with an excellent opportunity to catch up, not only with one 
another but also with sponsors, group contacts and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to extent heartfelt thanks to the incredible organisers and volunteers, speakers and attendees who make FOSDEM (and other 
such events) possible, and I would also like to thank those of you who took the time to speak with us, provide feedback, thoughts and 
words of appreciation. It is nice to be reminded that you appreciate the freenode project, and that you feel it adds some value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often find that a large proportion of our time is spent dealing with spam or other problematic behaviour, and
it is all too easy to forget that the incredibly small minority of users that create issues are just that, a minority, and that the vast
proportion of our userbase consists of amazing human-beings who collaborate on exciting, important and curious projects. And perhaps we
also sometimes forget to show our appreciation of the incredible work you all undertake within the FOSS and peer-directed project spaces. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2018 23:19:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>"Joe-Job" spam on other networks referring to freenode</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/joe-job-spam</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It has come to our attention that someone is going around other IRC networks,
spamming channels with racist messages which suggest that they are promoting a
channel here on freenode, and that we are aware and supportive of such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are monitoring the situation, but there's little we can do when they're
targetting other networks, but we'd like to clarify that we of course do not
support any racist or hate-inciting behaviour, which is strictly against our
&lt;a href="http://freenode.net/policies"&gt;terms of use&lt;/a&gt;, and that the channel(s) referenced
in the spam messages are in no way connected to the spam - rather they are
innocent victims of a "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_job"&gt;Joe Job&lt;/a&gt;"
designed to disrupt them as well as freenode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there's little we can do to stop it on other networks, reporting each
individual sighting, particularly in #freenode, is of limited value and likely
to cause more noise than signal, but feel free to message a staffer (use the
&lt;code&gt;/stats p&lt;/code&gt; command to see who's available) if you have concerns, or particularly
if you are part of the oper/staff team on another affected network and want to
talk to us.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">bigpresh</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2017 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>On Shadowbans</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/shadowban-fix</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It's recently come to our attention that an unintended effect of combining
channel modes allowed channel operators to set undetectable bans and quiets on
users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;freenode considers this to be, in short, antithetical to our values and approach
to moderation. While we recognise the challenges of moderating large channels,
we urge channel operators to be as transparent as possible, and believe that
users should be aware of moderation action taken against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of this, we are deploying a change to the &lt;code&gt;$j&lt;/code&gt; extban. As of tomorrow
UTC, &lt;code&gt;$j&lt;/code&gt; will ignore ban exceptions set on the target channel, seeing the same
effects as an uninvolved user checking its ban list.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">edk</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2017 23:59:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>freenode #live - even more confirmed speakers</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/freenode-live-more-speakers</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, we &lt;a href="/news/freenode-live-speakers"&gt;announced more confirmed speakers&lt;/a&gt;
for the &lt;a href="https://freenode.live/conference/fn-live17"&gt;freenode #live conference&lt;/a&gt;
taking place at the At-Bristol Science Centre in Bristol, UK on 28-29th October 
this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we are happy to announce more speakers:&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">bigpresh</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2017 23:15:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>freenode #live - more confirmed speakers</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/freenode-live-speakers</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The freenode #live team are excited to announce more confirmed speakers
for the &lt;a href="https://freenode.live/conference/fn-live17"&gt;freenode #live conference&lt;/a&gt;
taking place at the At-Bristol Science Centre in Bristol, UK on 28-29th October 
this year, with plenty more still to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the variety of speakers, talks and workshops we've had submitted, we're
pleased to announce the following confirmed lineup:&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">bigpresh</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2017 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Spambot attack</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/spamwave</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this morning, the freenode network was hit by a fairly extensive spambot attack, the spambots were distributing links to images that 
users have reported as containing child pornography images. Naturally, we are escalating the attack to law enforcement, but we would strongly 
encourage users to be vigilant and careful not to open links from users you do not know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the attacks are ongoing we have chosen to update the default umodes for users to include +R, please note that this means you will not receive messages from unregistered users and you will need to /mode yournick -R in order to allow those to come through. If you choose to set yourself -R, please be cautious of clicking on any links from unregistered users that you do not know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the height of the attack, one of the klines set resulted in a utility bot attempting to ban all users connected to the network, 
I can only apologise for this and we are looking into what happened. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 10:05:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>freenode #live - Opening Keynote</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/opening-keynote</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce the first of our keynotes for the freenode #live conference taking place at the At-Bristol Science Centre in Bristol, UK on 28-29th October this year. We have more keynotes to announce and these will be announced over the next couple of weeks. We also hope that you will join our brilliant line-up of speakers, and that you are considering &lt;a href="https://freenode.live/conference/fn-live17/program/proposal/new"&gt;submitting a talk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening keynote is a thoroughly inspiring woman with extensive experience of the various aspects of the free software communities, and we are really excited to welcome none other than the glorious Deb Nicholson to Bristol in October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freenode network plays host to a variety of free and open source software and other peer-directed projects. We would love to see your project come exhibit at freenode #live and we invite you to e-mail us at exhibit@freenode.live if you are interested in coming along to showcase your project and meet like-minded FOSS enthusiasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aim to ensure that the freenode #live conference remains affordable and accessible to the entire community, and to that end there is no exhibition charge for nonprofits and unincorporated FOSS projects. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2017 09:29:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>freenode #live - Registration and CFP now open</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/freenode-live</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The inaugural freenode #live conference takes place at At-Bristol in Bristol, UK from Saturday 28 to Sunday 29 October 2017.

We have now completed our review and updated the &lt;a href="https://freenode.net/policies"&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt; accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2017 11:26:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>PIA and freenode joining forces</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/pia-fn</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am incredibly excited to be able to share some amazing news with you today.
For the last few years, Private Internet Access has been a dedicated supporter
of the freenode project and we are delighted to be able to announce that
freenode is now officially part of the PIA family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;freenode has been providing services to Free and Open Source Software projects,
peer-directed projects and other projects that have a broadly licensed output
for the past 18 years, and there is a great deal of overlap between the visions
and missions of the two organisations, as well as the projects and
organisations the two organisations have supported, albeit in very different
ways over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob (lilo) founded freenode with the aim of providing a useful service to Free
and Open Source Software communities, peer-directed projects and others and I
think he would be proud of the growth we have experienced over the years if he
were still here to see it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">christel</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2017 20:03:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Django AMA</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/django-ama</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Start thinking of tricky questions!
Once again &lt;a href="http://freenode.net/news/community"&gt;the freenode community team&lt;/a&gt;
is pleased to announce another Ask Me Anything (AMA). This time &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;
will be our guest. Read more about them in the
&lt;a href="http://freenode.net/news/django-and-freenode"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; published last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your chance to ask Django all your questions about them:
How do they utilize freenode? How can you contribute? And just who are these
Django Girls we've heard so much about? Anything that you would be interested
in learning about them, here's your opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMA is scheduled to take place on Wed Feb 22 18:00:00 UTC, 2017,
so grab your calendar and make sure you don't miss it.
You can watch the AMA in #freenode-ama and participate by asking questions
in #freenode-ama-questions during the session. In the meantime be sure to
visit their channel, #django, and get a head start on everyone else!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Swant</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2017 17:55:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Django and freenode</title><link>https://freenode.net/news/django-and-freenode</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For nearly twelve years, the &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django Project&lt;/a&gt;
has endeavoured to improve "the web framework for perfectionists with
deadlines." Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourage
rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced
developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development,
so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the
wheel. Of course, it's free and open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m contracted full-time by the Django Software Foundation
&lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/#fellowship-program"&gt;as a fellow&lt;/a&gt;,
to manage some of the administrative and community management tasks of
the Django project to support rapid development of Django itself. The
fellowship program has a major positive impact on how Django is
developed and maintained, and I’d encourage any large open source
project to consider a similar program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Django community is vibrant across the globe, with many annual
conferences and local meetups. Sprints are often held at these events,
but Django’s development is mainly coordinated remotely, so good
communication tools are important to us.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tim Graham (timograham)</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 20:00:00 +0100</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
