## Dev Requirements:

* [Myth](http://www.myth.io/)
* [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo)
* [cms7](https://github.com/edk0/cms7)

## Building

With dependencies installed, just run `cms7`.

## Git

`master` is automatically deployed to https://freenode.github.io/web-7.0/. It
is also configured to reject commits that haven't had a build succeed in a
branch or pull request; make one and ideally get someone else to confirm.

Branches are cheap; use one per feature.

Changes should be tested on both big and small screens.
