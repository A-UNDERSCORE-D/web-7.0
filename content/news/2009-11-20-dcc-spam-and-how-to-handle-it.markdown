On this topic, please be sure to only accept DCC requests from trusted users and to be cautious about them at all times.Â  You may wish to consider filtering out the DCC requests using your clients ignore functions, or enabling umode +C to prevent CTCP messages from being received. If you would like help with these topics feel free to stop by #freenode or your clients support channel.

As always, thank you for using freenode.
