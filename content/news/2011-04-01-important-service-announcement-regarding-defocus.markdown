The new bot, known as brrflrqxt, will voice users as they send the command "!join" to #defocus and those who pass its tests will be allowed to keep their voice. The tests involve problem solving, proving that you are human, and therefore capable of lying, cheating, and backstabbing like any valuable member of #defocus; thus ensuring a safe and productive environment for all our users.

If you have any questions about this policy, feel free to ask any member of staff.
