title: 'Defocus''s visit to the opticians: new guidelines'
As a result of the efforts of allÂ the fantastic people involved in that channel, we now have a new set of guidelines for #defocus. You can read them on [our website](http://freenode.net/pounddefocus.shtml).

Hopefully these changes bring the guidelines up to date with the general expectations and aims of the channel. As always, comments are welcome!
