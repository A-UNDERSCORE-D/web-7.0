title: Server Hosting
This leaves us with three main rotation servers.

Another host has notified us that his provider will be doing router work this weekend, which will occasion downtime.  In order to prepare for that downtime, we'll need to remove his server from the main rotation.  **That will leave us with two main rotation servers.** At peak load, those two servers will have to handle 5,000 users each. We simply do not have any servers which can handle 5,000 users for any length of time.

PDPC wants to continue to offer freenode.  But we need your help.

If there's any chance at all you can host a server, please look at our  [server hosting page](http://freenode.net/hosting_ircd.shtml).  We can't keep going from crisis to crisis. We can't predict whether a given server will work well in the main rotation. But unless we try a fairly large number of new servers, beginning immediately, we are simply going to have to discontinue the service. The more main rotation servers we have, the smaller the load on each server. So, if you think you can help, please take a look at the  [web page](http://freenode.net/hosting_ircd.shtml)   email us as quickly as possible, at this email address: staff at freenode dot net.

We can't do this without you.
