Finally, we asked the editors of   [Computerworld](http://www.computerworld.com/)  to provide an  [RSS feed](http://www.computerworld.com/news/xml/coverage/0,5451,2046,00.xml)  for their  [SCO coverage page](http://www.computerworld.com/news/special/pages/0,10911,2046,00.html),  and they were kind enough to set it up and write us back in about an hour. You may want to add this to your newsbot or add it to knewsticker or your Evolution summary page, to help keep up with the news.

Have a great evening!
