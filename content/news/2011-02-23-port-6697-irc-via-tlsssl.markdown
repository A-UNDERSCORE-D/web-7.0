title: 'Default port for IRC via TLS/SSL (hint: it''s 6697)'
The Internet Draft linked above will not be made into a proper RFC quickly as these things tend to take a lot of time, but for all intents and purposes, 6697 is the canonical port for IRC via SSL/TLS, today.

**Update:** In case we didn't make it clear enough (apparently we didn't): You can still continue to use all other ports we have listened to in the past. But we will start recommending 6697 from now on.

**Update2:** Yes, we are listening on port 6697 on all our ircds, be they IPv4, IPv6, or .onion.
