Hello all,

We'd like to get a few rounds of changes into our software stack and it would be
enormously helpful if anyone with a bit of spare time could help us test them.

To that end, we're running some of them on testnet, where you can join us at
`chat.freenode.net:9003` (use TLS) or `testnetb64n7zeyi.onion`. Services
databases are not synced and the network is liable to be shut down, restarted or
reset at any time.

You can find the ircd patches we're testing at any given time [on GitHub][1].

Thanks!
