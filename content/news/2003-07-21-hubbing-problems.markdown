title: Hubbing Problems
Finally, we continue to work on testing  [dancer-ircd 1.0.32](http://freenode.net/news-2003-05-28.shtml).  We're currently at 1.0.31+pre22.  There will be at least one more pre-release for feature cleanup, but what we have running on the  [testnet](irc://irc.freenode.net:9001)  (irc.freenode.net, port 9001) is as solid as we can make it at test loads.  Please help us test by opening up a client or two or a hundred.  We really need your help. We'll be going back in to clean up the hubbing this afternoon or evening, in line with whatever changes we make to the production environment.  Stop in first chance you get.

Have a great day!
Edit:

As an added "nudge", it's contest time. Be the first to find any new reproducible bug on the test net (irc.freenode.net, port 9001) and win a **yournick.bugcatcher.freenode** spoof for a month on the production network. :) We'll make it **yournick.bugslammer.freenode** for a reproducible segfault. [Submit to bugs at freenode dot net --Ed.] Extra points for providing a patch.  Limit one person per bug. :)
