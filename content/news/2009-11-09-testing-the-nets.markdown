title: Testing the nets
To connet, use testnet.freenode.net for ipv4 or ipv6. Port 9002 listens for regular connections, while 9003 listens for SSL.

We want a lot of traffic, and while we don't normally encourage it -- you are welcome to bring bots and drones en-masse! So bring in the bots, simulate traffic, join your regular channels, talk or spout nonsense. You can find us all in #freenode when you've connected to the testnet.

To connect from irssi: "/connect -ssl testnet.freenode.net 9003" for ssl and "/connect testnet.freenode.net 9002" for non-ssl.
To connect from xchat, first **open a new tab**, then "/server -ssl testnet.freenode.net 9003" for ssl and "/server testnet.freenode.net 9002" for non-ssl.

Thank you for using freenode and for helping us out, and freel free to drop by #freenode on either network to report any issues you might have with the testnet.

--update--

Some of you are asking about user and channel modes, many of which will have changed.  You can get a listing of the user and channel modes and what they mean with "help umode" and "help cmode" respectively.  Some clients will allow this directly, using "/help umode" or "/help cmode" but in many you will need to instead use "/quote help umode" or "/quote help cmode"  Some clients also use /raw in place of /quote.
