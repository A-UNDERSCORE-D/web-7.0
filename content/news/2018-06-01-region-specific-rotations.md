Over the years we have had many requests for the ability to connect to servers
in a specific region of the world, and we are pleased to announce the
availability of region specific rotations! You can now connect to freenode via:

* `chat.eu.freenode.net`
* `chat.us.freenode.net`
* `chat.au.freenode.net`

We also added `chat.ipv4.freenode.net` and `chat.ipv6.freenode.net` which only
contain IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, respectively. This was another feature which we
heard many requests for, since some clients do not have the ability to manually
choose which IP address to use.
