title: '[Announcement] PDPC Fundraiser'

<blockquote>  _     Whereas Peer-Directed Projects Center is an IRS 501(c)(03) organization,     with a responsibility to contribute to the public welfare, and whereas     donors to PDPC represent a broad range of community participants, and     whereas the recent tsunami has demonstrated a genuine need for public     support for international relief and welfare organizations, and

Whereas the welfare of children, nationally and internationally, is of     significant importance to the future of Free and Open Source Software and     Peer-Directed Projects, be it

Resolved, that during the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2005, one quarter of     each donation to PDPC beginning in the near future will be forwarded to     UNICEF, initially targetted toward tsunami relief efforts, provided that     donors who so choose may opt out of this program and designate their     donations specifically and solely for PDPC's own use, and

Resolved, that the Executive Director is instructed to begin this program as     soon as is feasible from a technical, financial and public relations     standpoint.   _</blockquote>
