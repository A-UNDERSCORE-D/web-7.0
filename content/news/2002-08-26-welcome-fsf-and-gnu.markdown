title: Welcome FSF and GNU!
Robert Levin, president of Peer-Directed Projects Center, added: "We welcome the opportunity to work more closely with the Free Software Foundation.  Licensing that preserves freedom is essential to the health and success of peer-directed projects.  The Free Software Foundation's pivotal role in advocating software freedom makes it a valued contributor to the community."  _

To all of the members of the GNU project who've spent so much time with us so far: thank you for your support, and welcome officially to **freenode**!
