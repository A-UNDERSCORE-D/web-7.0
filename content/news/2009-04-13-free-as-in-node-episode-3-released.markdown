title: Free-as-in-node episode 3 released!
In addition, we'll let you know whats going on in the world with our take on the talks between Sun and IBM, Debian eating FreeBSD, the new Gnome 3.0 roadmap, and news on TomTom's settlement with Microsoft.  We'll also talk about Fedora11beta with updates on our experience on the next episode.

We also discuss the "geeknic" once again with the announcement of yet another geeknic, this one in the Philadelphia area in less than a week! If you can make it, bring us a canoe or kayak.

This week closes again with a wonderful morsel from Bryn_S.  We'll see you in two weeks!
