Excerpts from the NEWS file follow:


<blockquote>

>     
>     Various bug fixes. Highlights include:
>     
>       Bans of the form *!*@!* are now corrected properly, rather
>       than placing a confusing ban on remote servers.
>     
>       Kill reasons work again
>     
>       Bans are no longer broadcast to channel members while being
>       synchronised on burst. This could potentially hide an
>       unexpected ban, but the amount of data makes the broadcast
>       largely useless anyway.
>     
>       Remove cmode +F. Forwarding finally appears safe for general
>       use.
