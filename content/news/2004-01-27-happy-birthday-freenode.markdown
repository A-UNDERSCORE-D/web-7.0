title: Happy Birthday freenode!
Today, **freenode** peaks at over 15,000 users, and we're home to coordination channels for such projects as Debian GNU/Linux, fedora, Gentoo, KDE and subversion.  We're the official IRC network of the Free Software Foundation's GNU project; we provide support channels for FreeBSD, GNU/Linux and a variety of free software applications. But the real conceptual moment when the network was born was early in 1994, on 29 January at 01:49 UTC, when I first joined the channel #linuxneo.

So, happy birthday to us!  Ten years later to the minute, on 29 January 2004 at 01:49 UTC, the birthday party will begin in channel **#linuxneo** on **irc.freenode.net.** It'll last all day. Grab an IRC client, get a little  [help](http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/ircprimer.html)  setting it up, and come join us on  freenode!
