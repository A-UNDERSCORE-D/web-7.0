[Global Notice] Hi all, we're having some major issues with
connectivity at the DC hosting one of our hidden hubs, I'm
going to re-route around it,  which will cause about twice
as much noise as the splits already made. Apologies for the
inconvenience.

These and other issues are a large part of the reason for the upcoming migration to ircd-seven, and we still need your help in that regard.  We are still in need help testing the new ircd and working out the bugs.  If you would like to help out, have a look at [this ](http://blog.freenode.net/2009/11/testing-the-nets/)posting for information on how you can test the new ircd.

Thank you for using freenode, and have a great day!
