Thank you for using freenode!

**ADDENDUM:** Thursday 25 March 2004 at 07:20We'll be making one more change to cloaking near the end of the week.  At midnight UTC on Saturday morning (Friday evening in much of the US), we'll be simplifying the **foo.registered.freenode** cloaks.  From that point on, they will be simply: **foo.registered**.  Thanks!

**ANOTHER ADDENDUM** Friday 26 March 2004 at 04:57We're going to go ahead and make the **foo.registered** change in a couple of minutes, but we'll change it in the services database, and not on any live nicks until sometime after midnight UTC.  Some people will get the new cloaks, but it'll be a mixed bag.  Services will be down for a bit. Thanks!
