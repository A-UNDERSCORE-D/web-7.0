`/quote mode $yournick +w`

or

`/umode +w`

in your IRC client. Please note that you need to do this every time you connect so setting up an auto-command or similar makes sense. In case you want to stop receiving wallops without reconnecting to freenode, simply run

`/quote mode $yournick -w`

or

`/umode -w`

and you are all set. Hopefully, we will manage to come up with interesting news for you. Feedback on this in #freenode or via this post is appreciated.
